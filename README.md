# Mealific 

Many people struggle when planning meals.  Too many recipes call for ingredients we don't have, which results in a visit to the grocery store, or takeout.  We may have all the ingredients in our kitchens we need to create a delicious meal, and we just may not be realizing it.  Mealific is a search engine that utilizes the Edamam API to display recipes based on ingredient(s) input.  Less thinking, more cooking.
